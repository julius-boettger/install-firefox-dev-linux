# Automatically install Firefox Developer Edition
> on your Debian-based Linux distribution

# Usage
```bash
curl --location "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julius-boettger/install-firefox-dev-linux/master/install_firefox_dev.sh" --output ~/Downloads/install_firefox_dev.sh && bash ~/Downloads/install_firefox_dev.sh && rm ~/Downloads/install_firefox_dev.sh
```

# ToDo
- improve usage command (can it be executed instantly without creating/deleting files?)
- make script safer by checking for present installations etc
- pass language locale for firefox as argument to script
- write an actual README.md
